    <p>One night she had dream about the beast.She was in the forest plucking fruits and she realised a huge shadow was beneath her.
        She was frightened and fear rose in her body.She looked closely at the shadow beneath her and she saw a musculine figure.
        On the shadow she also saw two horns and a tail.She ran with all her energy she had on her body. 
        She reached on a cliff as she saw the shadow coming closer to her.The fruits that were on her basket were; </p>
    <ol>
     <li>Mango</li>
     <li>Orange</li>
     <li>Apple</li>
     <li>Passion</li>
    </ol>
     <P>She dropped them since they were getting bulky to continue running with them.
         She jumped over a cliff as she was going to hit the ground she waked up with a loud scream.
         Its when she realised it was only just a dream.

     </P>
